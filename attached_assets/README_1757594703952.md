# Strategic Success Lab — starter

A small, fast static site you can deploy on GitHub Pages or Netlify without paying extra. Custom domain ready.

## Files
- `index.html` main page
- `styles.css` minimal styling
- `script.js` loads `portfolio.json` into cards
- `portfolio.json` edit your projects here
- `assets/favicon.png` and `assets/og.png` placeholders
- `CNAME` sets the custom domain for GitHub Pages

## Deploy: GitHub Pages
1) Create a repository named `strategicsuccesslab` or whatever you like.
2) Commit these files.
3) In repo Settings → Pages, set Source to `Deploy from a branch`, Branch `main`, folder `/root`.
4) Add the custom domain: `strategicsuccesslab.com`. This creates a `CNAME` file or use the one included.
5) In your domain DNS, create a CNAME for `www` pointing to `<your-username>.github.io`.
6) Either set an ALIAS/ANAME or A record for the root apex to GitHub Pages per their docs, or set your registrar to forward the apex to `https://www.strategicsuccesslab.com`.

## Deploy: Netlify (optional)
1) Import the repository.
2) Netlify auto-builds static files. No build step needed.
3) Set the primary domain to `strategicsuccesslab.com` and add `www` as an alias. Netlify can handle redirects and certs.

## Edit content
- Open `index.html` and change text under the hero, approach, proof, and contact sections.
- Update `portfolio.json` with real projects. Links are optional.
- Replace `assets/og.png` with a 1200x630 image and `assets/favicon.png` with a 64x64 icon.

## rj.works
Use registrar forwarding from `rj.works` to `https://strategicsuccesslab.com` or point DNS to the same host and add a redirect.
