## Project Architecture

### Core Files
- `index.html` - Main landing page with enhanced sections (hero, value pillars, portfolio, proof stats, about, contact)
- `styles.css` - Original CSS foundation with comprehensive design tokens 
- `theme-premium.css` - Premium design system layer with enhanced colors, animations, and micro-interactions
- `script.js` - JavaScript for dynamic portfolio loading from JSON
- `portfolio.json` - Portfolio/case study data
- `assets/` - Images (favicon.png, portrait.png)
- `CNAME` - Domain configuration for strategicsuccesslab.com

### Design System
**Premium Color Palette:** Professional blues (#0B5FFF accent, #00D4AA secondary) with sophisticated neutrals  
**Typography Scale:** Inter font family with enhanced weight hierarchy (medium, semibold, bold, extrabold)  
**Animation System:** Floating hero background, card hover elevations, button shine effects, navigation underlines  
**Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with graceful degradation  

## User Preferences
**Brand Positioning:** Operator-led consulting with measurable outcomes, no-fluff approach
**Target Audience:** High-growth tech companies, executives seeking revenue acceleration  
**Conversion Goals:** Primary - book strategy calls via Calendly; Secondary - email signups; Tertiary - direct inquiries  
**Visual Style:** Modern, premium aesthetic that justifies $50k+ engagements with subtle animations and sophisticated interactions

## Current Site Structure
1. **Hero Section** - Revenue architecture positioning with premium CTA
2. **Value Pillars** - 4 core service areas with icons and clear value props
3. **Client Impact** - Portfolio cards loaded dynamically from JSON
4. **Approach** - 4-step methodology grid 
5. **Proof** - Stats grid with quantified outcomes
6. **About** - Founder story with credibility indicators
7. **Contact** - Embedded Calendly for conversion

## Technical Considerations
- **Pure Static Site** - No build process, ready for GitHub Pages/Netlify deployment
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal dependencies (Google Fonts only), efficient CSS loading
- **SEO Ready** - Meta tags, OpenGraph, JSON-LD structured data
- **Accessibility** - Focus states, motion preferences respected, semantic HTML
- **Browser Compatibility** - Modern CSS with fallbacks for backdrop-filter and other advanced features

## Deployment
**Primary:** GitHub Pages with custom domain strategicsuccesslab.com  
**Workflow:** Python static server on port 5000 for local development
**Domain:** CNAME configured for strategicsuccesslab.com with www forwarding

## Next Steps (Minor Improvements)
- Add "Services" navigation link to new Value section
- Clean up duplicate CSS in theme-premium.css  
- Enhance portfolio.json with richer case studies (metrics, outcomes, logos)
- Consider Services detail pages and Case Studies expansion per rebrand brief

## Rebrand Brief Status
**Completed:** Steps 1 (design highlights) and 6 (homepage upgrade) - site successfully elevated to premium consultancy experience
**Remaining:** Steps 2-5 and 7-11 for full multi-page expansion (services pages, case study details, expanded content)
